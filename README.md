👤 Hi there, welcome to my github profile. I am a citizen interested in almost everything, but especially in politics and things around the web 🌐. I love building small web-apps to show disturbing or funny things, for example a web app to compare every german member of parliaments twitter usage [Bundestwitter (german)](https://github.com/skriptum/bundestag).

🐍 I started trying things out in Python some time ago, and now I am a big fan of it, visible in my repos. The next thing I want to do is write my own library for an API-Wrapper
