👤 Hi there, welcome to my github profile. I am a citizen interested in almost everything, but especially in politics and things around the web 🌐. I love building small web-apps to show disturbing or funny things, for example a web app to compare every german member of parliaments twitter usage [Bundestwitter (german)](https://github.com/skriptum/bundestag).

Take a look at my Page for more info ![link](https://skriptum.github.io/blog/)

🐍 I started trying things out in Python some time ago, and now I am a big fan of it, visible in my repos. Currently, i am working on a package wrapping the Zeit Online API

⚙️ Technologies I use and things i do
- [x] **pandas** (big dataframes with ten thousands of entries)
- [x] **jupyter notebooks** for data science things
- [x] **python OOP** (object oriented programming) for my zeit package
- [x] **Flask** and **Dash** for web apps
- [x] **git**, obviously
- [x] **APIs** (like twitter and zeit)
- [ ] *sklearn* , learning
- [ ] *Pytorch*, not yet
